# Apollo documentation

Documentation and guide site for the Apollo Discord bot built with [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

## Local development

First, you'll need to install [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv).

Then install dependencies and start the dev server:
```
pipenv install
pipenv run mkdocs serve
```

The site should now be running at http://localhost:8000/

## Contributing

Pull requests are always welcome!

If you'd like to contribute, but aren't sure where to start, please get in touch on the [Apollo Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/dMnZt6P).
